      <h1>Visit Gambia</h1>
      <h4>
        The Gambia gained its independence from the British in 1965 as a
        constitutional monarchy within the Commonwealth. The Gambia then became
        a Republic within the Commonwealth in 1970 with Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara
        as the first Prime Minister and Head of state. In The Gambia we speak 11
        different languages, with English as our official language. One of the
        most famous sons of The Gambia is Kunta Kinteh who was kidnapped from
        his village in Juffureh and sold into slavery, which became the
        beginning of his remarkable journey. Gambia was also part of the Mali
        Empire with a very famous ruler ‘Mansa’ named Mansa Musa
