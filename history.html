    <h1>A History Lesson</h1>
    <p>
      The Gambia gained its independence from the British in 1965 as a
      constitutional monarchy within the Commonwealth. The Gambia then became a
      Republic within the Commonwealth in 1970 with Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara as
      the first Prime Minister and Head of state. In The Gambia we speak 11
      different languages, with English as our official language. One of the
      most famous sons of The Gambia is Kunta Kinteh who was kidnapped from his
      village in Juffureh and sold into slavery, which became the beginning of
      his remarkable journey. Gambia was also part of the Mali Empire with a
      very famous ruler ‘Mansa’ named Mansa Musa
