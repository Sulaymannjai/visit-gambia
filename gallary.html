    <h2>Why to visit Gambia</h2>
    <p>The Gambia gained its independence from the British in 1965 as a constitutional monarchy within the Commonwealth. The
    Gambia then became a Republic within the Commonwealth in 1970 with Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara as the first Prime Minister
    and Head of state. In The Gambia we speak 11 different languages, with English as our official language.
    One of the most famous sons of The Gambia is Kunta Kinteh who was kidnapped from his village in Juffureh and sold into
    slavery, which became the beginning of his remarkable journey. Gambia was also part of the Mali Empire with a very
    famous ruler ‘Mansa’ named Mansa Musa <img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansa_Musa" target="_blank" alt="Home town of Kunta Kinteh">
